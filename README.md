I created this Studio Ghibli inspired web-application to demonstrate that I am able to communicate with a back end using the Studio Ghibli API  in 
order to make requests and use the returned data to populate certain webpages (filmography, 
people) with the relevant data (films, characters) that the user can query through via a drop-down
list.
This web-application is also web-responsive.
